# ReadWrite
Simple program with examples of how to read/write between console and files in Java.

## Functions
• Reads inputs from console, extracts digits from inputs and prints them out with two leading zeros and two decimal points of precision.<br>
• Reads inputs from console, prints inputs to console using BufferedWriter.<br>
• Reads inputs from console, overwrites, appends or creates a new text file with the input file name and contents.<br>
• Reads contents from specified file, prints contents to console.

## Heads up
Running the program 'as-is' might not produce expected results.<br>
You may have to configure the values of `String STRING_PATH` & `Path PATH` to fit your machine.<br>
I recommend changing the value of `STRING_PATH` to your project directory.<br>
###### Example: "C:/User/Documents/Projects/Programming/ReadWrite"
